Hey, Welcome to my homepage! My name is Fan Chang(Chinese name 常帆). I am a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at Nankai University, under the supervision of Associate Professor [Lei Yu](https://lei-yu.github.io/). I received my B.S. in Mathematics from Shandong University in 2023, advised by Prof. [Guanghui Wang](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/wangguanghui1/zh_CN/index.htm). I am currently working with Prof. [Hong Liu](https://www.ibs.re.kr/ecopro/hongliu/) and the [Extremal Combinatorics and Probability group](https://www.ibs.re.kr/ecopro/) (ECOPRO) at the [Institute for Basic Science](https://www.ibs.re.kr/eng.do) (IBS).
